# Scala Implementation of _dp_multiq_

This GitHub repository contains a Scala implementation of the code originally found in the google-research [repository](https://github.com/google-research/google-research/tree/master/dp_multiq). This project aims to provide an alternative implementation of the same functionality using the Scala programming language.

## Overview

The original repository implements JointExp (and IndExp) as detailed in [Differentially Private Quantiles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08244).  JointExp is carefully structured to allow for an efficient implementation that returns estimates of all m quantiles in time $O(mnlog(n)+m2n)$. Experiments show that our method significantly outperforms the current state of the art on both real and synthetic data while remaining efficient enough to be practical.
